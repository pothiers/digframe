digframe
=======================

Transform a photo collection for use on digital photo frame. 

Given the screen size of a digitial photo frame and a collection of
images, convert the images to that they will fit nicely on the
display.  A combination of picture resizing and padding will be used
to create new pictures that exactly fit the target screen. If the
input images contain captions embedded in the image header, those
captions will be "burned" into the image so they will show as part of
the image when displayed in the digital photo frame.
